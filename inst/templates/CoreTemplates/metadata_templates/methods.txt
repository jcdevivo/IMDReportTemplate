Mean daily flow data were acquired for all gaging stations in national park units, or HUC-12 watersheds that intersect with park boundaries. Station metadata were queried from the Water Quality Portal at http://www.waterqualitydata.us using the dataRetrieval R package (Hirsch and De Cicco 2015) to identify stations with historic mean daily flow data (parameter code 00060 and statistical code 00003). Preparation of data for metric calculation includes two steps. First, all stations where the maximum mean daily flow is 0 cfs are identified and removed from the data set. Second, because metric calculation requires continuous time series data, the period of record is evaluated for small data gaps (two days or less) and missing values are interpolated. Periods of record were examined for null values to determine whether any missing values could be estimated based on flow data preceding and following the gaps. Time series were evaluated to insert missing dates, and any data gaps of two days or less were interpolated using the fillMiss function within the waterData R package (Ryberg and Veccia 2017). The span parameter was set to 3 resulting in the use of simple linear inerpolation to replace missing values. All remaining records with flow values of NA were removed from the dataset.

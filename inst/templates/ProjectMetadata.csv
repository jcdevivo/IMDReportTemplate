abstract,"This data report (and associated data sets) documents the acquisition and preparation of stream daily flow data for use in calculating a series of hydrologic metrics as a part of the NPS Park Environmental Setting monitoring protocol (DeVivo et al. 2018). Acquisition and preparation of data is a three-step process. First, mean daily flow data from stations of interest are acquired from the USGS National Water Information System (NWIS) at https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis. Second, the data are evaluated and processed to ensure their suitability for use in calculating hydrologic metrics by a) eliminating stations with maximum flows of 0, and b) interpolating data gaps of two days or less. Last, the period of record for each station is inspected to identify uninterrupted, whole-water-year sub-periods of two years or more. The resultant flow and period-of-record data will later be used to calculate roughly 200 hydrologic metrics describing flow conditions in and around national parks."
